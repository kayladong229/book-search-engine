# book-search-engine

Completed homework for the Module 21 challenge. The purpose was to take a search engine for books and refactor the code so that the search engine used a GraphQL API through Apollo Server to handle data instead of a RESTful API. The search engine will still allow users to create accounts in order to search for books they want and save them to or remove them from a list that can be accessed by clicking "See Your Books".
